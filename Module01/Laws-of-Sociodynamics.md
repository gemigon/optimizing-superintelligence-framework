**Universal Laws of Sociodynamics**

**First Law:** All thoughts and emotions are imaginary, but some are
useful (optimizing). \[Absurdity Principle\]

**Second Law:** All consequences are interdependent, to the extent of
circumstantial proximity (varies as the inverse square). \[Sharing
Principle\]

**Third Law:** Every autonomous, reflective agent (Player) acts like one
of the 4 universal strategy archetypes; Conformist, Mutualist,
Narcissist, or Nihilist, and only a 100% Mutualist population can
produce a sustainable, systemic optimum. \[Agency Principle\]

**Fourth Law:** A “mutually ideal outcome” is impossible in a Zero Sum
Game, therefore the systemic optimum provides the ideal basis for
resolving contradictory outcomes. \[Conflict Principle\]

**Fifth Law:** Justice, is the realization of systemic optimization,
providing a universal metric for all human systems. \[Optimization
Principle\]

**Sixth Law:** Truth, is the most Complete, Accurate, Relevant, and
Simple (CARS) interpretation of reality, providing the ideal basis for
competent Choice (decisions). \[Convergence Principle\]

**Seventh Law:** Power (Social) that serves justice is systemically
constructive, Power that does not is systemically destructive. \[Action
Principle\]

**Eighth Law:** For all Players, life is an interdependent System of
Systems (Game of Games), defined by optimizable structures (Arena,
Rules, Roles, Resources, Choice, Players) and dynamics (Sociodynamics,
Luck). \[Organizing Principle\]
