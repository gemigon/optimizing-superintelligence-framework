Universal Governance

Freedom of Assembly naturally produces associations of people through
commonality. The level of social bonding (affinity) determines communal
system integrity and sustainability.

The purpose of a legitimate governance system is to successfully manage
the optimum balance between providing Security/Safety while protecting
Individual Freedoms. \[Security/Freedom dichotomy\].

A consequential strategy is necessary for a sustainable community
(communal system) that supports the governance system.. The 8 essential
affinities \[and respective context\] that define social bonding in a
community (political) are:

Common Language \[interpersonal communications\]

Common Code of Justice \[rules\]

Common Territory \[proximity\]

Common Genetic Lineage \[evolutionary trajectory\]

Common Welfare (Quality of Life) \[sustainability\]

Common Culture (Beliefs and Behaviors) \[limits\]

Common Family Orientation \[natural unit\]

Common Loyalty (Commitment) \[communal preservation\]

A modern, self-sufficient “Nation” requires a political community of
more than 200,000 families (natural). A legitimate governance system
(government) is a fictitious entity created through a Contract (formal
or informal) among and between the members of a Nation. Governments and
corporate organizations are fictitious entities (Players) imagined into
existence through Contract among real entities (humans). All governance
organizations establish hierarchical internal roles with each specific
authority and accountability relationship embedded within the structure.
