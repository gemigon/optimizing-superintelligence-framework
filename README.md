# optimizing-superintelligence-framework
Open source project to develop a universal Optimizing Superintelligence Framework (OSF)

A project to develop an OSF of universal causal principles for all systems involving autonomous agents. The prime directive at the heart of the OSF is "optimize everything" (systemic optimization).

All non-optimizing (suboptimal) frameworks are incapable of consistently and sustainably producing optimal systemic outcomes (even when intended). Those frameworks are the root cause of the "uncontrollability problem" (predatory agents) as a primary risk for superintelligence, and therefore excluded from consideration in this project.

The project references human systems in order to provide a concrete model for reverse engineering of superintelligence principles. All of the architecture source is written in multi-modal pseudocode (natural language). The pseudocode utilized in this project includes simple tables, matrices, lists, line graphics and text.

The project documentation is divided into specific sections, but all of them are interdependent with each other (unified). The top level design model is the Agentic Systems Architecture (ASA), of which the OSF is the core component (reasoning engine).

To get up to speed quickly on this project, start with the core principles contained in the beginning sections (Universal Agent Archetypes, Universal Laws of Sociodynamics, Universal Justice, Universal Social Power). The founding document (anonymous) for this project is available as a backport reference (The Optopian Strategy) in the docs folder.

Collaboration can be directly addressed by contacting the project curator (gemigon at gmx dot com).
