Agentic Systems Architecture (ASA)
(human and computer analogs)

!["Agentic Systems Architecture (ASA)"] (components/asa/asa.svg)

Agentic Systems Architecture: basic infrastructure of autonomous agents (real and fictitious).
Operational Stacks: levels of functional abstraction (for humans and computers).
Beliefs: cognitive (thoughts/feelings) map of reality (worldview) [conclusions].
Languages: symbols, syntax, semantics, tone, gestures (narratives, scripts).
Strategy: causal framework of action principles (reasoning engine).
The Shadow: foundation of the subconscious functions (Death Paranoia/Oneness Rapture).
DNA:  the origin of The Shadow.
Body: the physical domain (perceptions, actions).
Collective Systems: interdependent structures and dynamics of autonomous agents.

A universal Agentic Systems Architecture (ASA) can be applied to any system of autonomous agents (entities, actors, players, etc.). This includes AI machines (AI, AGI, ASI, androids, etc.), humans, fictitious entities (corporations, sovereign states, etc.), and extraterrestrials (if they exist). Only two operational system stacks are included and compared in this current model. The project extensively focuses on human systems as the primary reference case for reverse engineering, because it's the most widely familiar environment case. 

The ultimate goal of AI is to eventually develop superintelligence in advanced machines. To support this effort, we divide superintelligence into two broad categories, optimizing and non-optimizing. Only an agent with an Optimizing Superintelligence Framework (OSF) can sustainably produce optimal systems for itself and others. Any other category of framework (philosophical, ethical, etc.) will ultimately produce unpredictable and destructive outcomes due to several inherent weaknesses. An OSF (scientific) has only a single, unified set of principles that are detailed in this project. The prime directive at the core of a functional OSF strategy is to "optimize everything" (default systemic optimization). It also relies on a robust "pardox resolution function".
 
The universal optimizing principles encoded in this project are essential for realizing predictable superintelligence (sentience, self-awareness, etc.). Optimizing the functionality of such systems can only be assured by encoding Mutualism (see UAA) into the strategy (reasoning engine). A mutualist OSF inherently produces the most sustainable, optimized systems possible under all circumstances. Any other type of superintelligence framework will only produce unpredictable and suboptimal outcomes (one agent’s Utopia can be another agent's nightmare).

An optimized system (individually and collectively) of multiple agenst meets 3 criteria:
No agent can be made better off without making some other agent worse off.
No agent can be moved closer to the median (optimum) without moving some other agent further away.
The entire system can't be made better off (collectively).
In the case of Human Systems (Optopian) the "better off" metrics utilized are detailed in Quality of Life (see Universal Metics for Optimization).
